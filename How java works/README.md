How Java Works:

1. Developer writes code → MyProgram.java
2. Compiler (javac) converts code → MyProgram.class (bytecode)
3. JVM reads bytecode and converts to machine code
4. Program runs on any OS because JVM handles platform conversion
5. Memory and garbage collection handled automatically

What is JDK
     Developer use panra tools(javac,debugger,JRE)ellam included
What is JVM
     Actual Bytecode aa run panna engine
What is JRE
     Java program run panna thevayaana environment(JVM + libraries)
